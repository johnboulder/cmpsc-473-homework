/**
 * Goal: Implement my own versions of malloc and free
 *
 * Hints: 
 * Use sbrk() and mmap()
 *
 * To avoid corruption in multithreaded applications, mutexes are used internally to protect the memory management data
 * structures employed by these functions.
 *
 * Set errno to ENOMEM, indicate what went wrong when something does go wrong
